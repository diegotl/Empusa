## Work in progress
This is a pretty early version, mostly a P.O.C. Several resources and features are yet to be added very soon. This README shall also be improved. Feel free to contribute to the project!

## Why εmpusa?
It's a reference to [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate). Empusa was the name of Hecate's daughter (or servant?).
